# final_project_clouse
# Methods
This is archival data from a Qualtrics survey for the Creative Arts for Veterans (CAV), an art therapy inspired self-paced book. Participants who have some connection with the military whether they are active, reserved
or married to someone in the service are encouraged to partake in this resource. Participants are guided through
an art-therapy inspired book, which will teach them self-regulation skills to cope with adverse life events through a military lens. [Here is the link to the Creative Arts for vets webpage, which was created by Indiana
University.] (https://rural.indiana.edu/focus/arts-culture/creative-arts-for-vets/index.html)

The file that is labeled final_project_plpaclouse.Rmd is the file that you need to download. If there is an
error with reading in the data, you will have to download the cav_results_3.16.25.csv file. After you download that, 
you should be good to go and you can re-knit the pdf!
